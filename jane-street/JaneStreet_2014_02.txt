Sum of squares
february 2014

Solving strategy:

I started from the last row and column, deciding how many 9s in each
go on with the hook 8, 7 and so on, looking at the possible combination (i.e. can the number in the hook 8 be a sum of 8s and a 9?), reasoning like that I could exclude all the wrong solutions and slowly build the right one
writing things on the board was very useful

Solution:

158

Time:
~ 32 minutes

best solution: 158
